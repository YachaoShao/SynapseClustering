# SynapseClustering
This is a repository of Synapse clustering method with using HCA and K-means. We put our code that we used to select features with using PCA and cluster methods with using HCA and K-means.

### Synaptic_parameter_selection
Matlab script for feature selection with using PCA, and Python script used for cross validation.

### PreAZ_PSD surface area
HCA Matlab script and K-means Python script used to cluster the dataset composed by parameters PreAZs and parameter PSDs.

### Pools of synaptic vesicles
HCA and K-means Python script used to cluster the dataset composed by distance of vesicle pools.
